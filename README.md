# CRR-ASSOCIATES
# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

Machine learning model to predict loan approval status using various classification algorithms.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Multiple algorithm implementation:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Performance comparison of models

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `crr associate.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and view results

## Data Preprocessing
- Handles missing values
- Encodes categorical features (Label Encoding)
- Splits data into training and test sets (80/20 ratio)

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy scores
- Confusion matrices
- Classification reports
